# Tech Used

1. ReactJs
2. Material U.I (AppBar, Toolkit )
3. CodeMirror Npm Package to detect html , css and js (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-codemirror2)
   ```npm install codemirror@5 react-codemirror2
npm install react-codemirror2 --legacy-peer-deps ```

# Major Learning
1. Handling Controlled (Contolled using react) and Uncontrolled components(controlled using form tags) by codemirror
2. Using context API for globally passing html,css and js variables's state.
3. using i frame in result component.
4. using useEffect to display result after user has typed the input instead of instantly updation dom by using settimeout.
